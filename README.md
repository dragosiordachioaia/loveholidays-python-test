# Django test

I've made the api with Django Rest Framework, and the front-end is a simple jQuery-powered page. I would have done it in React, but I've just updated my Mac to MacOS Mojave and it messed up my node installation so I couldn't get webpack to work properly anymore.

The API has some basic tests in place for the views.

In order for the app to run, you have to run the migrations first.

## Task

Create a simple todo app with the functionality to create/list/update/delete. The todo's should be stored in the database and the rest is up to you.

Please don't spend more than 2 hours on this. On completion, please provide a link to the completed task on your github.

## To run

`$ docker-compose up`

Please make sure your final solution still runs with docker.
